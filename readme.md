This software offers utilities to manage materials information using the [MatML v3.1 schema](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/documents.php?wg_abbrev=materials). An API is provided to inspect and edit materials information within other Python scripts (e.g., to read property data for a material used in an analysis) as well as a graphical user interface to visually inspect and edit MatML files.

## Quickstart

## Credits

### Acknowledgement

The initial API was created by conversion of the MatML 3.1 schema to a Python data structure via [generateDS](http://www.davekuhlman.org/generateDS.htm) by Dave Kuhlman.
